# EO Application Packages - hands-on

The [OGC Best Practice for Earth Observation Application Package](https://docs.ogc.org/bp/20-089r1.html) describes how to package EO computational workflows targeting their execution automation, scalability, reusability and portability while also being workflow-engine and vendor neutral.

This hands-on training targets EO application developers and provides an introduction to the Earth Observation Application Package concept and a set of real-life examples running on an Integrated Development Environment on Binder.

Discover the hands-on here: [https://terradue.github.io/ogc-eo-application-package-hands-on](https://terradue.github.io/ogc-eo-application-package-hands-on)

This hands-on was initially developed to support the OGC's [Developer Workshop at the 123 Member Meeting](https://github.com/opengeospatial/developer-events/wiki/Developer-Workshop-at-the-123-Member-Meeting)
